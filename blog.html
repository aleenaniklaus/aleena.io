        <p>New website, new blog!</p>

        <p> Over the past few months I've spent some time
            learning front end web development and decided
            what better way to apply that knowledge than by
            rewriting my website? </p>
        
        <p> Previously, I was using a Bootstrap template, 
            <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/themes/grayscale/">grayscale</a>. 
            It was nice, and got the job
            done, but I didn't learn much in the process. Since 
            the last time I touched HTML/CSS was in my
            full stack class a couple years ago, this was a
            fun way to be productive.  </p>

        <p> On top of re-learning HTLM & CSS, I used 
            <a href="https://scrimba.com"/>Scrimba</a> to
            get my hands dirty with ES6, HTML5, and React. They
            have tons of free tutorials and the 'bootcamps' are
            perfect for people who know how to code already and 
            really just need a nudge to use a new framework.
        </p>

        <p> Intuitively, it makes sense to learn what's dominating
            the software engineering market. At PSU we didn't 
            have a web dev track to follow, so a lot of the roles 
            out there for software engineers don't apply to my C++
            background.
        </p>

        <p> The most difficult part of learning web dev in my opinion
            is that there's so many ways to accomplish a given task. 
            Start with JavaScript. You 
            could use vanilla JS, or something like React if you'd 
            like. And then, within JavaScript there are many ways 
            syntactically to write a function, as an example. This 
            is in stark contrast to C++, where every function's 
            structure is the same syntactically.
        </p>

        <p> Likewise with back end... options galore (which is why
            I'm still surprised anyone picks PHP)! I
            chose Node with Express. For templating the site, I 
            almost picked up Mustache when I realized that 
            using Node and Express is enough to template out the
            <em>head</em> and <em>footer</em>. Then using regular 
            expressions, pull out a simple string from the HTML 
            and replacing that with the content of a given HTML page.
            Voila!
        </p>

        <p> If you're wondering about London, check out my new section, 
            <a href="gallery.html">gallery</a>. Right now, gallery has 
            my top pictures from London (out of 6700 + photos). I thought
            it was going to rain, and I'm not even kidding you. It only 
            rained the first day I was there! The rest of the trip was 
            pure sunny, London love.</p>
            
        <p> The gallery page will be treated as a visiting
            gallery. The images will rotate just as if it were a museum.
            I'll shoot out emails when a new gallery has arrived, so make
            sure to subscribe below if you'd like my curated gallery 
            with images taken by yours truly.
        </p>

        <p> You might notice <em>work</em> has replaced the old professional
            tab. I think it's more useful to have a tab talking about 
            the projects I've done, and possibly a small demo there. Stay 
            tuned for that!
        </p>

        <p>The best part about rewriting the website is now I can
            share it with you all! Check out my Github and give it 
            a looksee. Pull it down if you like, or request PRs for more
            features!
        </p>

        <p> With the new website comes one blog a month! Whether 
            it be blog, gallery, or otherwise. I hope to summarize some 
            self-motivated continued-learning strategies once 
            I have perfected them!
        </p>

        <p> Happy holidays!</p>

        Currently I am job hunting for the perfect fit for my skill set.
        I tend to pick up new technologies easily and have perfected
        the <em>'just-in-time'</em> learning concept. However, I hope to work 
        somewhere I can focus all my efforts in a specific domain. My interests are
        in full stack development, iOS development, and data science. My internship 
        at eBay helped me to become proficient in design patterns and Swift.
        Recently I've learned CSS, React, and JavaScript while rebuilding this website. And
        since I have a math major under my belt, combined with my CS 
        degree give me a leg up with roles related to data science/analytics.
